Stress Detection with Wearable Sensors
This is a data science project developed for a company that has developed a wearable watch with multiple sensors. The goal of the project is to investigate whether the sensors can be used to predict stress and develop a new feature that alerts a user when they're getting stressed. The project involves two assignments:

 Load, explore, clean, and preprocess the data set. Identify which signals might be better candidates for predicting stress.
 Develop a machine learning model to predict stress using the cleaned data set. Present findings and recommendations in a report.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/dg22712/stress-detection.git
cd stress-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data
The data set used in this project is provided by a university that has run a pilot test with some volunteers. The data set is included in this repository in the data folder.

Results
The results of this project can be found in the report Stress_Detection_Report.pdf. The report includes an analysis of the data, details on the machine learning model developed, and recommendations for the company.

Future Work
There are several avenues for future work and improvements in this project. One potential area for improvement is in the feature engineering stage, where more domain knowledge could be incorporated to improve the accuracy of the model. Additionally, further testing could be done to ensure that the model performs well across different populations and is not biased towards a specific group.
